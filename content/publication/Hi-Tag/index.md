abstract: Protein-mediated chromatin interactions can be revealed by coupling proximity-based ligation with chromatin immunoprecipitation. However, these techniques require complex experimental procedures and millions of cells per experiment, which limits their widespread application in life science research. Here, we develop a novel method, Hi-Tag, that identifies high-resolution, long-range chromatin interactions through transposase tagmentation and chromatin proximity ligation (with a phosphorothioate-modified linker). Hi-Tag can be implemented using as few as 100,000 cells, involving simple experimental procedures that can be completed within 1.5 days. Meanwhile, Hi-Tag is capable of using its own data to identify the binding sites of specific proteins, based on which, it can acquire accurate interaction information. Our results suggest that Hi-Tag has great potential for advancing chromatin interaction studies, particularly in the context of limited cell availability.
