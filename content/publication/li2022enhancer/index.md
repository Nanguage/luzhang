abstract: Gene expression programs are intimately linked to the interplay of active cis regulatory elements mediated by chromatin contacts and associated RNAs. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many variants in these regulatory elements that can contribute to phenotypic diversity. However, the functional interpretation of these variants remains nontrivial due to the lack of chromatin contact information or limited contact resolution. Furthermore, the distribution and role of chromatin-associated RNAs in gene expression and chromatin conformation remain poorly understood. To address this, we first present a comprehensive interaction map of nuclear dynamics of 3D chromatin-chromatin interactions (H3K27ac BL-HiChIP) and RNA-chromatin interactions (GRID-seq) to reveal genomic variants that contribute to complex skeletal muscle traits.
