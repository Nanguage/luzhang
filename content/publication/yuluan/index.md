abstract: The liver plays a key role in metabolism and affects pig production. However, the functional annotation of noncoding regions of the pig liver remains poorly understood. We revealed the landscape of cis-regulatory elements and their functional characterization in pig liver. We identified 102,373 cis-regulatory elements in the pig liver, including enhancers, promoters, super-enhancers, and broad H3K4me3 domains, and highlighted 26 core transcription regulatory factors in the pig liver as well. We found similarity of cis-regulatory elements among those of pigs, humans, and cattle. Despite the low proportion of functionally conserved enhancers (~30%) between pig and human liver tissue, ~78% of the pig liver enhancer orthologues sequence could play an enhancer role in other human tissues. Additionally, we observed that the ratio of consistent super-enhancer-associated genes was significantly higher than the ratio of functionally conserved super-enhancers. Approximately 54% of the core regulation factors driven by super-enhancers were consistent across the liver from these three species. Our pig liver annotation and functional characterization studies provide a system and resource for noncoding annotation for future gene regulatory studies in pigs. Furthermore, our study also showed the high level functional conservation of cis-regulatory elements in mammals; it also improved our understanding of regulation function of mammal cis-regulatory elements.
